		Basic Quickies, originally referred to as just <a href="http://www.calworkouts.com/quickies/">Quickies</a>, are recommended for those who have successfully performed all the <a href="http://www.calworkouts.com/quickies/junior/">Junior Quickies</a> in under 2 minutes with solid form and also completed the Junior Quickies Like A Boss.  It is important to achieve these goals because it shows that you are fit enough for this level.  We certainly do not want you injuring yourself because you were too impatient or not ready for these quickies.  If you still need to ease out of Junior Quickies, it is suggested to do the easiest <a href="http://www.calworkouts.com/quickies/cardio/">Cardio Quickies</a> first because they have a wider range of difficulty.  Unlike Cardio Quickies, Basic Quickies are primarily focused on strengthening muscles and do not get your heart pumping as fast.  They were designed with an "older" school of training, but effective nonetheless.  As these quickies get easier, attempt to do them Like A Boss or Like A BAMF (refer to the variations tab) so eventually you can move on to <a href="http://www.calworkouts.com/quickies/suicide/">Suicide Quickies</a>.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Go Hard or Go Home!</span><br/><br/>
